The source code for both programs (they work dependently on one another) can be found in [make_and_read.cpp](./make_and_read.cpp) and [read.cpp](./read.cpp).

To get a feel for how they work, run [read_pipe_process](./compiled/read_pipe_process) and [make_and_write_pipe_process](./compiled/make_and_write_pipe_process) in separate terminal tabs/windows. These were compiled and tested on Mac OS, but should also work on any Unix based system (i.e. Linux). To run in Windows OS, you'll have to recompile both programs (.cpp files) into windows executables.
