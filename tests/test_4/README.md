# Test 4 (Final) Review
**PDF** [Final Review](test_4_study.pdf)

The final review is a compilation of all test questions from tests 1 - 3. 

The answer to 12 is that there is no deadlock, but not because of the explanation given (essentially, just ignore all of those lines). There is no deadlock because there are no cycles in the graph. Each resource appears to only have one instance, so if there +is a cycle in the final, then there will likely be a deadlock.
